* Amiresponsive images or equivalent can go here

PicQuest is an app where users are give the task to photograph something during the day/week e.g. a duck, some street art, a stranger, an interesting plant or tree. The app allows users to easily create accounts with their names which they can add and remove images from. Users are encouraged to like images and add comments in order to to connect with eachother. Moderators can monitor images and comments posted.
The home page is centred around a “most liked” feature - presented in a continuously updating collage style. This allows users to compare and contrast their photographs with those of other users. 

## Collaborators
The team for this hackathon project is made up of @Enquil - Jim Olesen, @Dante-Cadiz - Dante Cadiz, @debbiect246 - Deborah Thompson, @lizac9 - Liza Carelli and @MariusBujor - Marius Bujor.

## Content
* Navigation to subheadings (UI design, UX design etc.) can go here

## UI Design
* page layout
#### **Typography:**
The font ‘’ was chosen for the title, which welcomes the user to the website. The decision to use this font was influenced by the font used in.. The body font is called ‘’. This font results in a more balanced and clear legibility for the remainder of website. In the case that one of the other fonts can't be loaded, they will fall back to a sans-serif font.

#### **Colour Scheme:**

* Flowchart can go here
* User Experience with images and responses to user inputs
* Accessibility

## Datamodel
* Can also go into UX design subheading, but probably better with separate subheading.

## Libraries & Programs Used:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/):
    - GitHub is used to store the project's code after being pushed from Git.
3. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/):
    - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
4. [Am I responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbytes.dev):
    - This application was used for visualization of the application on diferent devices.
5. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/):
    - Cloudinary was used to store and link the images.
6. [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) 
    - Heroku was used for deployment, the specification is in the deployment section.
7. The Code Institute's GitHub full template for Python is used in order for the program to display properly in the deployed site on Heroku.


## Testing
* Lighthouse tests at https://web.dev/measure/
* Pep-8
* Jigsaw validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
* HTML markup https://validator.w3.org/

## Deployment
The site has been deployed through Heroku.
The site has been developed on GitPod, committed and pushed to GitHub. Heroku will update automatically once the site is deployed. 

Deployment Heroku proccess:
1. Log in Heroku. 
2. Click in the "New" button in the top right.
3. Select "Create New App"
4. Choose a name to the App and choose a region.
5. Click in "Create App" button.
6. You must then create a Config Var called PORT. Set this to 8000.
7. When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. Select  "Add Buildpacks". 
8. Add Python and save, do the same for Node.js, in that order. Python must show first in the list.
The ordering is as follows:
    1. heroku/python
    2. heroku/nodejs
9. Go to Deploy in the nav bar. In Deployment Method, select GitHub/Connect to GitHub.
10. In Connect to GitHub, write the repository name and click in search.
11. Once the route for the repository appears under the search, click the "Connect" button.
12. The deployment can be Manual or Automatic, select your preference. Automatic has the advantage of updating your deployed site as you push the commit in GitHub.
13. Verify that "Branch to deploy" is master/main.
14. Click Deploy and the link with live project will appear
